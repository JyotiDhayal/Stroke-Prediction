# Stroke-Prediction
This project builds a classifier for stroke prediction, which predicts the probability of a person having a stroke along with the key factors which play a major role in causing a stroke. Stroke Prediction can be done considering various features such as age, heart disease, smoking status, etc. Analyzing the dataset to get insights about the probability of an individual to suffer from a stroke and the features of the dataset are applied to the five different machine learning (ML) models which are used to predict stroke, and their performance is compared. The goal is to investigate the factors that determine the chances of stroke. The data can then be used to create a system that predicts stroke and the major reasons which cause stroke.
